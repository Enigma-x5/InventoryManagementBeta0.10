  # Fix RLS policies for orders table to allow anon access

  This migration addresses the 401 Unauthorized errors by updating the RLS policies
  on the orders table to work with the application's custom authentication system.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Disable existing authenticated-only policies**: Remove policies that rely on 
     Supabase's auth.uid() function since the app uses custom authentication
  
  2. **Add anon access policies**: Create new policies that allow anonymous access
     to match the application's client-side filtering approach
  
  3. **Maintain INSERT restrictions**: Keep INSERT policies restrictive to prevent
     unauthorized order creation

  ## Security Note
  
  This change allows anonymous users to read orders data directly from Supabase.
  The application relies on client-side filtering for role-based access control.
  For production use, consider implementing proper Supabase authentication integration.
