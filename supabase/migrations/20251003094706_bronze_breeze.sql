  # Fix RLS policies for custom authentication system

  This migration updates the RLS policies to work with the custom authentication system
  by allowing operations for the anon role, since the application handles authentication
  and authorization internally.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Drop existing conflicting policies
  2. Create new policies that allow anon role access
  3. Application-level authorization is handled by the frontend
